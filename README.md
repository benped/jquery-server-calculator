# Project Name

JQuery Server Calculator

## Description

Duration: 1 Weekend Project

This was built over the course of 48 hours. It takes the inputs from the calculator buttons, sends them to a node.js server, which parses the numbers and operators and returns an array of problems and solutions. 

The client side then displays that array on the dom, with the last answer prominent. 

Users can clear the array with the delete button. 

## Prerequisites
Node.js
Express
Javascript
Jquery 

## Installation

npm install  should get you everything you need. Has a module for express and for body-parser.
